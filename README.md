# Online SGD L1 Regression

Based on the following paper: Pesme, Scott, and Nicolas Flammarion. "Online robust regression via sgd on the l1 loss." Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 2540-2552.

In this project, the goal was to use concepts of convex optimization to develop a robust online L-1 regressor that is immune to black-box based adversarial attacks. 
The project involved: 
1) Using Convex Optimisation techniques to explore the dataset by reducing the features and samples independently 
2) Repeat Step 1 but both are done at once 
3) Develop an On-line regressor variant using Steepest Gradient Descent. 


This project was one of the ten projects shortlisted from a group of 128 projects to be presented to the class.
